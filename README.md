Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin.

I am a NLP Data Scientist but I have done a few projects on CV and Time Series as well.

I have dedicated a lot of time in learning the ins and outs of transformer-style (Encoder/Decoder) models, like BERT and GPT-2.
Some of my work is documentated here in the form of my attempts to fine-tune the models. 

I also have Data Engineering and Python Dev skills.
My current stack is SQL, OOP Python, Git, GCP, Docker, Flask and all important ML and DL libraries.
