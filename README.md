Hi, I’m @Kevin. I’m a self-taught Data Scientist. My interests lie in creating computationally efficient NLP models. 

I have dedicated a lot of time in learning the ins and outs of transformer-style models and some of my work is documentated here in form my attempts to fine-tune the models. 
In the process of self-teaching I have also become profient in SQL, OOP Python, Git, Docker and Flask. Feel free to reach out.
