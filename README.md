Hi, I’m @Kevin. I’m a Data Scientist specializing in NLP. 

I have dedicated a lot of time in learning the ins and outs of transformer-style models and some of my work is documentated here in the form of my attempts to fine-tune the models. 

I also have Data Engineering skills in SQL, OOP Python, Git, GCP, Docker and Flask. Feel free to reach out if you have any requests or questions.
